    Once upon a time in a small hamlet known as Pallet Town, there lived a ten-year-old boy named Ash. One day, Ash decided to leave town to go on a massive adventure that would take him far from home. In short order, he was traversing through many different cities and countrysides and accumulating travel companions along the way, despite the fact that he had not yet even graduated grade school. The point of this adventure was not immediately clear at the beginning. Ash only knew that he wanted to be 'the very best, like no ever was.' One day as he entered Saffron City with his new friends Brock and Misty, the universe finally revealed to Ash what he would be working towards being the very best at.
