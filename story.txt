  Once upon a time in a small hamlet known as Pallet Town, there lived a ten-year-old boy named Ash. One day, Ash decided to leave town to go on a massive adventure that would
take him far from home. In short order, he was traversing through many different cities and countrysides and accumulating travel companions along the way, despite the fact that he
had not yet even graduated grade school. The point of this adventure was not immediately clear at the beginning. Ash only knew that he wanted to be 'the very best, like no ever
was.' One day as he entered Saffron City with his new friends Brock and Misty, the universe finally revealed to Ash what he would be working towards being the very best at.

As Ash was walking around Saffron City, he noticed a huge building that was called the Saffron City Gym. Being the enthusiastic trainer that he is, he wanted to take on the gym
leader, Sabrina, in order to win the Marsh Badge from her. He gathered all the Steel and Dark types he could for his team and went to battle against Sabrina. He took on Sabrina
and after an intense battle, won against her too! With the Marsh Badge in his hand, he walked to the next stop: Cinnabar Island.
